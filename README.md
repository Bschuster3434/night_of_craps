Craps Simulation Experiment

Before a trip to Vegas, I decided I wanted to see how long my money could last if I played Craps.
Specifically, how long could I expect to last if I started with $$$ amount of money, bet $ per hand, and played the same way regardless of my outcome.
This was the inspiration for this program.

The similation file runs 1000 'nights' of craps, playing a simple strategy of betting.
For each night, two pieces of information are recorded: Max Amount Expected and Number of Rolls Played.
From their, more ad-hoc analysis can be completed.
