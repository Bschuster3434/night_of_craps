Craps Simulation Experiment

Before a trip to Vegas, I decided I wanted to see how long my money could last if I played Craps.
Specifically, how long could I expect to last if I started with $$$ amount of money, bet $ per hand, and played the same way regardless of my outcome.
This was the inspiration for this program.
